# TicTacToe Game Application

Project Overview: During my 5th semester of Degree, my colleagues and I developed a TicTacToe Game Application using Android Studio and Java. 
This mobile and desktop-compatible application allowed users to play a classic 4x4 grid TicTacToe game, with the option of Player vs Player mode. 
Additionally, the game integrated user account management and statistical reports.

Technologies used : Android Studio, Java, XML, SQLite

Key Features:

Game Development: Created a TicTacToe game with a 4x4 grid, where players take turns marking spaces until one achieves three consecutive marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).

User Authentication: Implemented sign-up and sign-in functionality using SQLite database to store player data locally, ensuring secure access with usernames and passwords.

CRUD Operations: Enabled full CRUDS operations (Insert, View, Update, Delete, Search) for managing player information, allowing the host to control player data effectively.

Player Statistics & Reporting: Integrated graphical reports in the form of pie charts and bar charts. Points were calculated based on the outcome: 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, and 0 for a loss.

This project helped me improve my Android development skills, strengthen my understanding of database management (SQLite), and learn how to generate graphical reports to visualize data. 
It also enhanced my proficiency in Java and mobile app development.
